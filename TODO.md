# ASM-Bots TODO List

## Improvements to implement

### Assembly Language Parser
- Support more syntax features (e.g., comma-separated operands)
- Handle metadata directives (`.name`, `.author`, etc.)
- Add support for comments and annotations
- Implement macros and constants

### Instruction Execution
- Implement full instruction set rather than simplified version
- Add support for more addressing modes
- Optimize critical instruction execution paths
- Implement specialized instructions for common operations

### Battle Visualization
- Create a memory view to see bot activity
- Show execution traces during battles
- Add visualization for process queues and states
- Implement replay functionality for analyzing battles

### Tournament Functionality
- Allow multiple bots to compete in round-robin or bracket format
- Add scoring and statistics
- Implement rating system for bots
- Create leaderboards and match history

### Performance and Debugging
- Add profiling for memory and CPU usage
- Implement debug mode with step-by-step execution
- Add logging levels for detailed analysis
- Create performance benchmarks for bots

### Documentation
- Improve instruction reference documentation
- Create tutorials for bot programming
- Document best practices and strategies
- Add examples and templates for new users
