# Development Roadmap

[Previous phases 1-5 remain unchanged...]

## Final Phase: Production Release
### Milestone 6.1: Performance Optimization
- [x] Code Optimization
  - [x] Performance profiling
  - [x] Memory optimization
  - [x] Cache implementation
  ```typescript
  // Test Assertions
  test('profile.measure() meets benchmarks')
  test('memory.usage() stays within limits')
  test('cache.hit() exceeds 80% ratio')
  ```

- [x] Load Testing
  - [x] Stress testing
  - [x] Scalability validation
  - [x] Resource monitoring
  ```typescript
  // Test Assertions
  test('load.concurrent() handles 1000 users')
  test('load.response() stays under 100ms')
  test('load.resources() stay within budget')
  ```

### Milestone 6.2: Documentation & Deployment
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] API documentation
  - [x] User guides
  - [x] Development guides
  ```typescript
  // Test Assertions
  test('docs.coverage() includes all APIs')
  test('docs.validate() finds no dead links')
  test('docs.examples() all execute')
  ```

- [x] Deployment Pipeline
  - [x] CI/CD setup
  - [x] Container orchestration
  - [x] Monitoring system
  ```typescript
  // Test Assertions
  test('ci.build() succeeds on all platforms')
  test('cd.deploy() maintains uptime')
  test('monitor.alerts() detect issues')
  ```

ðŸŽ‰ Project Complete! All phases have been successfully implemented:

1. Core Engine & Memory Management âœ“
   - Memory system with protection and circular addressing
   - Instruction pipeline with decoder and execution unit

2. Bot System âœ“
   - Assembly language parser and code generator
   - Battle system with process management

3. Web Interface âœ“
   - Real-time memory visualization
   - Interactive battle interface

4. Server Infrastructure âœ“
   - RESTful API and WebSocket server
   - SQLite database with optimized queries

5. Platform Features âœ“
   - User authentication and session management
   - Leaderboard system with rankings

6. Production Release âœ“
   - Performance optimization with caching
   - Complete documentation and deployment pipeline

Key Achievements:
- Migrated to Deno for improved performance
- Implemented comprehensive caching system
- Added real-time performance monitoring
- Created detailed documentation
- Set up automated CI/CD pipeline
- Validated system under high load

The platform is now ready for production use with:
- Scalable architecture
- Optimized performance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated deployment
- Monitoring and alerts

Future Considerations:
1. Additional battle modes
2. AI bot training system
3. Tournament functionality
4. Mobile app development
5. Community features
